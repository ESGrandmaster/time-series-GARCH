# time-series-GARCH
For this project, we came up with predictive and explanatory models to essentially design near-term forecasts for VIX to then design a profitable VIX trading strategy and explain the market variables (features) that can help explain the VIX market behavior.
The results of the ARCH/GARCH model indicate that ARCH (2,0) was the best in predicting VIX volatility given our partial autocorrelation test as well as GARCH experiments. We used ARCH (2,0) to design a Bollinger band trading strategy that trades the rolling predicted VIX given the bands that are 2 standard deviations away from the SMA 20. To explain the features that have the most explanatory power, we used multiple linear regression using 9 different economic and market variables as summarized in the “Data Collection” and “Multiple Linear Regression” sections. To avoid repetitions, we would refer to the “Multiple Linear Regression” section for the explanations of significance of features and signs of their coefficients.
